Def Should do:

 - Auto Update Functionality: 
	Use a QThreadPool worker to listen to the email and in real-time return updates of new emails detected

 - Event Notification (Overlap GUI)
	Display a notification say like the top right corner regarding updates or soft errors

 - Error Notification
	Same idea as previous but different GUI design to show that a critical error occured
